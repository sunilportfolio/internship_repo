# project 1 

This Node.js application demonstrates a practical use of Express for handling HTTP requests and Mongoose for interacting with a MongoDB database. The project effectively covers CRUD operations, focusing on managing products and campaigns. Through this code, I learned various concepts in Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, gaining insight into building a full-stack application that handles data efficiently. This experience has deepened my understanding of how backend services work, emphasizing best practices for building scalable and reliable applications.

Starting with the foundational setup, the code imports essential modules such as Express and Mongoose. Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware. Mongoose, on the other hand, is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It enables schema-based solutions, which provide structure to MongoDB collections. The application initializes an Express app and configures it to handle JSON payloads using express.json(). This middleware automatically parses incoming JSON requests, making the body of the request accessible.

The application establishes a connection to a MongoDB database running on the local machine with the URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/test". The mongoose.connect() function initiates the connection, returning a promise that resolves upon a successful connection or catches errors in case of failure. This approach ensures the application gracefully handles database connection issues by logging appropriate messages.

One of the key aspects I learned from this code is defining schemas using Mongoose. Mongoose schemas are blueprints for MongoDB collections, allowing us to specify the structure, data types, and validation rules for documents. The campaignSchema and productSchema define two collections: "Campaign" and "Product." The "Campaign" schema includes fields like id, productId, name, description, amount, percentage, createdAt, and updatedAt. Each field has a specified data type, such as String, Number, or Date, and properties like required and unique. Similarly, the "Product" schema contains fields like id, name, description, price, category, url, stock, size, composition, color, weight, images, campaign_Id, and deleted. The schema also demonstrates the use of enums to restrict the category field to specific values: "Electronics," "Clothing," and "Food." Setting default values, such as deleted: false, ensures consistent data in the database.

This project also taught me how to create models from schemas using mongoose.model(). Models are used to interact with the database by providing methods for CRUD operations. For instance, Campaign and Product models represent the respective collections and enable operations like saving, finding, updating, and deleting documents.

The application provides various routes to manage products and campaigns. The /products POST route is responsible for creating new products and campaigns. It uses random numbers to generate unique IDs for the campaign and product, which is not ideal for production environments due to the risk of collisions. A better approach would involve using a package like uuid for generating universally unique identifiers. The route validates input data, ensuring mandatory fields like name, price, and category are present. It then creates new instances of the Campaign and Product models, populates their fields, and saves them to the database using save() methods. This approach guarantees that both documents are persisted, and if one operation fails, the error handling mechanism ensures an appropriate response is sent.

The /Get_all_products route uses MongoDB’s aggregation framework to implement pagination. Aggregation pipelines allow for complex data transformations, but the code currently lacks error handling for cases where pageNumber is undefined. It would be beneficial to set a default page value if none is provided. Additionally, storing pagination data in request body parameters is unconventional; using query parameters would be more appropriate. The aggregation pipeline uses $skip and $limit to control the number of documents returned based on the page number and page size. This approach is efficient for paginating large datasets, reducing the load on the client and server.

The /find_product route retrieves a specific product based on the provided ID. It uses the findOne method to query the database and select to filter the returned fields, which optimizes database performance by reducing the amount of data retrieved. The route effectively handles scenarios where the product is not found, returning a failure response when necessary. However, the route could be further enhanced by validating the input ID format to prevent database errors.

The /find_one_delete route demonstrates the use of findOneAndDelete to remove a product from the database. This method efficiently deletes a document by matching the provided ID. The route checks for a valid ID before proceeding with the deletion, and appropriate responses are sent based on whether the deletion was successful or if the document was not found.

The /update-product route illustrates how to update product details using findOneAndUpdate. It constructs an updatedObj from request data and executes the update operation. The use of exec() ensures the query is executed, but error handling could be improved by checking the update result to confirm the product exists. A potential issue in the code is the lack of validation for partial updates, which might lead to empty or undefined fields in the database.

From this project, I learned about using HTTP methods for CRUD operations—POST for creating, GET for reading, PUT/PATCH for updating, and DELETE for deletion. Implementing proper input validation and error handling is crucial for data integrity and reliability. The importance of database indexing and using unique identifiers for efficient querying was evident. Using environment variables for database URIs, port numbers, and other sensitive information would improve security and flexibility. The application could also benefit from using middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.

Although the code covers many essential aspects of a basic backend service, it could be further optimized by using middleware for input validation, environment configuration, and request logging. Additionally, handling promises more efficiently using async/await, improving error responses, and implementing validation libraries like Joi would make the code more robust.

Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of building a Node.js application with MongoDB using Mongoose. I learned the importance of data modeling, schema validation, and CRUD operations. The hands-on experience of writing code, debugging errors, and exploring MongoDB's aggregation framework has given me confidence in handling backend development tasks. The experience has been invaluable, providing practical knowledge and insights into building scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.

This Node.js application is a practical example of using Express for handling HTTP requests and Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB database. The project covers CRUD operations for managing products and campaigns, which helps me learn how to build a backend service that handle data in efficient way. This experience gave me good understanding of how backend application works, and show me some best practices for making scalable and reliable applications.

Starting with the setup, the code imports important modules like Express and Mongoose. Express is a popular framework for Node.js that make handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware more easy. Mongoose is a Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It gives a schema-based solution to structure MongoDB collections. The application sets up an Express app and uses express.json() middleware to handle JSON payloads, making request body easily accessible.

The app connects to MongoDB database running on local machine with URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/test". The mongoose.connect() function sets up the connection and returns a promise that resolves if connection is successful or catch errors if it fails. This way, the app handle database connection problems by logging error messages.

One main thing I learned from this code is how to define schemas using Mongoose. Mongoose schemas act like blueprint for MongoDB collections, letting us define structure, data types, and validation rules for documents. The campaignSchema and productSchema define two collections, "Campaign" and "Product". The "Campaign" schema has fields like id, productId, name, description, amount, percentage, createdAt, and updatedAt. Each field has specific data types like String, Number, or Date, and properties like required and unique. In the same way, the "Product" schema has fields like id, name, description, price, category, url, stock, size, composition, color, weight, images, campaign_Id, and deleted. Using enums to restrict category field to values like "Electronics", "Clothing", and "Food" is a good way to keep data consistent. Setting default values like deleted: false also make sure the data in database stays clean.

This project also show me how to create models from schemas using mongoose.model(). Models help to interact with the database by giving methods for CRUD operations. For example, Campaign and Product models represent the respective collections and make it easy to save, find, update, and delete documents.

The application provides different routes to manage products and campaigns. The /products POST route is used to create new products and campaigns. It uses random numbers to create unique IDs for campaign and product, but this can be risky because of chance of collisions. A better idea would be to use a package like uuid to generate unique IDs. The route checks input data to make sure important fields like name, price, and category are provided. Then it create new instances of the Campaign and Product models, fills their fields, and saves them to database using save() methods. This way, both documents are saved, and if one operation fails, the error handling makes sure the response is correct.

The /Get_all_products route shows how to use MongoDB’s aggregation framework for pagination. Aggregation pipelines are powerful for handling complex data transformations, but the code can be improved to handle cases where pageNumber is missing. It would be better to use query parameters instead of request body for pagination. The aggregation pipeline uses $skip and $limit to control how many documents are returned based on page number and page size. This approach is useful for handling big datasets without overloading client or server.

The /find_product route fetches a specific product based on the provided ID. It uses the findOne method to query database and select to filter returned fields. This reduces data load and improves database performance. The route handles cases when product is not found and returns correct responses. However, the route could be better if it also validate the input ID format to prevent database errors.

The /find_one_delete route shows how to delete a product using findOneAndDelete. This method quickly removes a document by matching the provided ID. The route first checks if the ID is provided before proceeding. Depending on whether deletion was successful, it sends appropriate responses.

The /update-product route shows how to update product details using findOneAndUpdate. It creates an updatedObj from request data and runs the update operation. Using exec() ensures the query is executed. However, error handling could be better by checking if product exists before updating. The code also needs validation for partial updates, so empty or undefined fields do not end up in database.

From this project, I learned how to use HTTP methods for CRUD operations—POST for creating, GET for reading, PUT/PATCH for updating, and DELETE for deletion. Implementing input validation and proper error handling is important for data consistency and reliability. It was clear how database indexing and unique identifiers improve query efficiency. Using environment variables for database connections and sensitive data would also be a better practice. The app could be improved by using middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.

Even though the code covers many important aspects of a backend service, it can be optimized by using middleware for validation, configuration, and logging. Handling promises better with async/await, improving error responses, and using validation libraries like Joi would make the code stronger.

Overall, this project was a great way to learn building a Node.js application with MongoDB using Mongoose. I understood data modeling, schema validation, and CRUD operations more deeply. Hands-on experience of coding, debugging errors, and using MongoDB’s aggregation framework helped me feel more confident in backend development. The experience is valuable, giving me practical skills and knowledge on making scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.

Got it! Here’s an 800-word report written in simple English, with a few intentional grammar mistakes, focusing on the experience of building the code:

Building this Node.js application was a very good experience for me. I created a backend service using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB that handle CRUD operations for managing products and campaigns. This project teached me lot about working with databases, handling HTTP requests, and using Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

First, I setup the application by importing Express and Mongoose. Express is a popular framework for Node.js that makes it easy to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware. Mongoose is a Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a way to structure and validate data in MongoDB. The code also sets up Express app and use express.json() middleware to parse incoming JSON data from requests.

Then, I connected the application to a local MongoDB database using mongoose.connect function. I passed the database URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/test" and used promises to handle success or error in connection. When the connection is successful, a message is logged, and if an error happens, the error is logged too.

One of the interesting part of the project was creating Mongoose schemas and models. Mongoose schemas are like blueprints that define how documents in a collection should look. I created two schemas: campaignSchema and productSchema. These schemas define data structure and rules for storing data in MongoDB.

The campaignSchema has fields like id, productId, name, description, amount, percentage, createdAt, and updatedAt. Each field has a data type, like String, Number, or Date. Some fields are marked required or unique to make sure important data is not missing or duplicated. The productSchema is more detailed, with fields like id, name, description, price, category, url, stock, size, composition, color, weight, images, campaign_Id, and deleted.

Using enums for category to limit values to "Electronics", "Clothing", and "Food" was a good way to make data consistent. Setting deleted field default to false also helped to keep data clean. Creating models from schemas using mongoose.model was a important step because models provide methods to interact with database easily.

The app have different routes for managing products and campaigns. The /products POST route is used to create new products and campaigns. It generates random numbers for productId and campaign_Id, but this approach can cause ID collisions. A better idea would be to use a library like uuid to create unique identifiers. The route validate input data and create instances of Campaign and Product models. It uses save() method to store documents in the database. This way, both documents are saved, and if an error happen, it returns a error response.

Another route, /Get_all_products, is used to get a list of products. It use MongoDB aggregation framework to handle pagination by using $skip and $limit stages. Pagination makes it easier to handle large datasets. This route could be improved by using query parameters instead of request body for pagination. Also, adding validation for missing page number would make it more robust.

The /find_product route fetches a product by its ID. It uses findOne method to search the database and select to return only specific fields. This reduces the amount of data transferred and improves performance. The route also handles case where product is not found and returns a proper response. However, it would be better if input ID format was validated to prevent database errors.

The /find_one_delete route deletes a product by ID using findOneAndDelete. This method quickly removes a document matching the provided ID. The route first check if ID is provided before proceeding. If the product does not exist, it returns a error message.

The /update-product route updates product details using findOneAndUpdate. It builds an updatedObj from request body and run the update operation. Using exec() ensures query execution. The code would be better if it validated partial updates, so empty or undefined fields are not stored in the database. Also, checking if the product exists before updating would prevent unexpected behaviors.

Building this project was challenging but rewarding. I learned how to handle HTTP methods for CRUD operations. POST is used for creating, GET for reading, PUT/PATCH for updating, and DELETE for removing data. Input validation and proper error handling was important to keep data consistent and reliable. Working with MongoDB’s aggregation framework was very helpful for understanding how to handle complex data. Using enums in schema helped to keep data consistent. Setting default values ensured that missing data does not create issues.

The code can be improved in some ways. For example, using middleware for validation, authentication, and logging would make the code cleaner. Handling promises better using async/await would avoid callback hell and make code easy to read. Using environment variables for database connection instead of hardcoding would be more secure. The application can also benefit from validation libraries like Joi for input validation.

This project gave me a deep understanding of backend development with Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. It was a great way to practice working with databases, schemas, models, and CRUD operations. Building it from scratch made me confident in setting up backend services, handling errors, and managing data. The project showed me the importance of writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.

Overall, building this application was a valuable experience. It made me more comfortable working with Node.js and MongoDB. I learned how to handle requests, interact with databases, and perform CRUD operations. I also learned best practices for data validation and error handling. This project is a strong foundation for developing more advanced backend applications in the future.

Here is a 1000-word report written in easy English with some grammar mistakes included:

Building this Node.js application was a very good experience for me. I made a backend service using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. The application handle CRUD operations to manage products and campaigns. This project teached me many things about using databases, handling HTTP requests, and working with Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

First, I setup the application by importing Express and Mongoose. Express is a framework for Node.js that make it easier to handle HTTP requests, routes, and middleware. Mongoose is a Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provide a way to define schemas, validate data, and create models for MongoDB collections. This make working with MongoDB easier by providing helpful methods. In the code, I also setup Express app and use express.json() middleware. This middleware parse incoming JSON data so it can be accessed in the request body.

After setting up Express and Mongoose, I connect to MongoDB using mongoose.connect. I passed the database URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/test" to connect to local MongoDB. The .then and .catch methods is used for handling success and error. When the connection is success, it logs "Database connected" to the console. If connection fail, the error is logged instead. This part of the code made me learn how to use promises in JavaScript. Promises help handling asynchronous operations, and using .then and .catch is a good way to handle success and errors.

Creating Mongoose schemas and models was one of the interesting part of this project. Mongoose schemas are blueprints that defines how documents should look in MongoDB. I made two schemas: campaignSchema and productSchema. These schemas define what fields should be stored, their data types, and validation rules.

The campaignSchema has fields like id, productId, name, description, amount, percentage, createdAt, and updatedAt. Each field has a data type like String, Number, or Date. Some fields are marked as required to make sure important data is not missing. The productSchema is more detailed with fields like id, name, description, price, category, url, stock, size, composition, color, weight, images, campaign_Id, and deleted.

For the category field in productSchema, I used enum to limit values to "Electronics", "Clothing", and "Food". Using enums ensure only valid values can be stored in the database. The deleted field is set to false by default to mark products as active. This approach can be useful in soft delete situations where product is not actually removed from database but marked as deleted. I created models from the schemas using mongoose.model. Models provide methods like save, find, findOne, update, delete, and others to interact with MongoDB easily. This part was useful in understanding how schemas and models work together in Mongoose.

The app has routes for managing products and campaigns. The /products POST route is used for creating new products and campaigns. In this route, I generated random numbers for productId and campaign_Id to create unique identifiers. But this approach can cause problems if same ID generated twice. A better idea would be using uuid or MongoDB’s ObjectId for unique identifiers.

In the route, I also validate input data before creating objects. If required fields are missing, an error is thrown. This ensures data integrity. Then, I created a new Campaign and Product using the models. The save method store documents in database. This method returns a promise, so I used await keyword to wait until save operation completes. If product and campaign are saved successfully, a success response is returned. Otherwise, an error response is sent.

The /Get_all_products route handles fetching all products. It uses MongoDB’s aggregation framework to handle pagination. Pagination makes it easier to work with large datasets by showing limited number of products at a time. The route use $skip and $limit stages to control the number of results. This method is efficient but can be improved by using query parameters for pagination instead of request body. Also, the route should validate page number to prevent errors.

The /find_product route fetches a product by ID. It uses findOne method from Mongoose to search database. The select method is used to include only necessary fields in the response. This approach reduce the amount of data transferred and make the response faster. If product is not found, a message is returned saying "Product not found". This route can be improved by validating input ID format before searching.

The /find_one_delete route deletes a product by ID using findOneAndDelete method. This method find the product and remove it from the database. Before deleting, it checks if ID is provided. If product not found, an error message is sent. Otherwise, a success message is returned.

The /update-product route updates a product by ID using findOneAndUpdate method. It create an object called updatedObj from request body and run the update operation. Using exec() ensures the query is executed. This route can be improved by validating input data before updating. Currently, it will store empty or undefined fields if not handled correctly. It would be better if it first check if product exists before updating.

Building this project teached me how to use HTTP methods for CRUD operations. POST is used for creating data, GET for reading data, PUT or PATCH for updating, and DELETE for removing data. I also learned importance of input validation and error handling to keep database consistent and reliable. Using MongoDB’s aggregation framework helped me understand how to handle large datasets and perform complex operations.

The code can be improved in many ways. For example, using middleware for validation, authentication, and logging would make the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Better promise handling using async/await would make the code easier to read and understand. Using environment variables for database connection instead of hardcoded values would make the application more secure. Validation libraries like Joi can be used for more detailed input validation.

Working on this project was challenging but rewarding. It helped me understand backend development with Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. I gained confidence in setting up backend services, handling requests, and managing data. The project showed me how to write clean and efficient code, and also the importance of error handling.

This project is a strong foundation for developing more advanced applications. I learned a lot about JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. The experience has made me feel more comfortable with backend development and understand how different technologies work together. I am excited to build more complex projects and learn new skills in the future. Working on this project has been a great learning journey and gave me the confidence to explore more advanced topics in Node.js and backend development.
