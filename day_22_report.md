 Day 23 report 
 
In a database, keys and joins are very important for managing and getting data. They help to organize information and make it easy to find and connect data from different tables. This report explains about primary keys, composite keys, foreign keys, inner joins, and left joins in a simple way with examples.

A primary key is a special column in a table that makes each row unique. It stops duplicate data from happening. For example, in a table of employees, the employee ID can be a primary key. It makes sure every employee has a different ID, so we can easily find their details. Primary keys are very useful because they help us quickly search, update, or delete specific data. If a table does not have a primary key, it would be hard to know which row is which, and mistakes could happen when working with data. Primary keys are important in many databases, like those used by schools, hospitals, or online shops.

A composite key is a primary key that has two or more columns. It is used when one column is not enough to make a row unique. For example, in a table about students and courses, we can use student ID and course ID together as a composite key. This way, it shows which student is in which course. It also stops the same student from being added twice for the same course. Composite keys are useful in cases where a single column cannot be unique. For instance, in a table recording exam results, the composite key could be made from student ID, course ID, and exam date. This helps track the right result for each student in each course. Composite keys are often used in school databases, company projects, and event management systems.

A foreign key is a column or columns in one table that connects to the primary key in another table. It creates a relationship between tables. For example, if there is a table called "Orders" and it has a customer ID that links to the "Customers" table, the customer ID in the orders table is a foreign key. It makes sure every order is linked to a real customer. If a customer is deleted, we can set rules to handle orders from that customer, like deleting the orders or keeping them. Foreign keys help databases stay accurate by stopping wrong data from being added. For example, in an online shop database, an order must have a valid customer ID, so the order is linked to the right customer. This also helps when showing reports or summaries, like knowing how many orders each customer made. Foreign keys are very common in databases used by banks, online stores, and companies.

Joins are used to combine data from two or more tables. An inner join only shows rows where there is a match in both tables. For example, if we join the "Orders" and "Customers" tables using customer ID, inner join shows orders that have a matching customer. This is good when we only want data that matches. Inner joins help get useful data from many tables, like finding which customers placed orders or what products are most popular. They are useful in sales, banking, and company reports where matching data from different tables is needed.

left join shows all rows from the first table and matching rows from the second table. If there is no match, it shows NULL for the missing data. For example, a left join between "Customers" and "Orders" shows all customers even if they have no orders. Customers without orders will have NULL in the order details. Left joins are very useful when we want to see all data from one table and related data from another table. In a school database, a left join between students and courses can show all students, even if some are not taking any courses. In online shopping, it can list all products, even if some are not ordered.

These database concepts are very useful. Primary keys make rows unique, composite keys make sure complex data is unique, and foreign keys connect tables. Joins help to get data from many tables at once. These skills are needed for database , developers, and data analysts. In real life, database keys and joins are used in many places. For example, in e-commerce, tables for customers, orders, and products are connected. Primary keys make each customer unique, composite keys link customers and products in orders, and foreign keys connect tables. Joins help get useful information, like customer orders or products bought by customers. 

#Database keys and joins make data easy to manage. They keep data correct and stop mistakes. They also make it easy to connect tables and find the right information. Knowing these concepts is important for anyone who works with databases, such as software develop ers, data analysts, and IT professionals. They help businesses work better and make good decisions based on data.
